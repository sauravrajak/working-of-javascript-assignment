#  1. Write a function called "addNumbers" that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Call the
function before it is declared to demonstrate hoisting.


#  2. Write a function called "multiplyNumbers" that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their product.
Use function expressions to define the function and call the function before it is declared to demonstrate
hoisting.



# 3. Write a function that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Declare a variable inside the
function using the var keyword and log its value to the console before it is assigned a value to demonstrate
variable hoisting.


# 4. Declare three variables, one using let, one using var, and one using const, all inside a block scope. Assign
them values and log their values to the console before and after they are declared to demonstrate variable
hoisting.


# 5. Declare a variable using let inside a block scope and attempt to log its value to the console before it is
assigned a value to demonstrate the temporal dead zone.
